Hi, I’m @mailcmd and I enjoy so much programming. 

- **I’m interested in:** well, many things, not only related to programming or technology. 
- **I’m currently learning:** mmmm, I guess one never stops doing it...
- **I’m looking to collaborate on:** Really I am not looking for anything in particular.
- **How to reach me:** Just open an issue in some of my respositories.
