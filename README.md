- Hi, Iâ€™m @mailcmd and I enjoy so much programming. 
- ðŸ‘€ **Iâ€™m interested in:** well, many things, not all of them related to programming or technology. 
- **Iâ€™m currently learning:** mmmm, I guess one never stops doing it...
- **Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on:** Really I am not looking for anything in particular.
- **How to reach me:** Just open an issue in some of my respositories.
